# Dijkstra

This project is a working example of using a greedy algorithm to find the fastest delivery path using a map of different addresses and a package list consisting of various locations on the map.

The project uses a hashtable to store the packages, and a graph to store the addresses.

A greedy algorithm is used to to find the shortest delivery path for any list of packages.

Package status is either at warehouse, on truck, or delivered.

When a package is delivered a delivery time is added to the package as well

A UI is included to check package status, or how many miles are used by each truck.
